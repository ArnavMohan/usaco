COMPUTER SKILLS  : Last updated on Jan 01 2018

Advanced level: I have had significant instruction on these and used these extensively for at least 3 years in multiple and complex projects.
OS: Android
Languages: Java, Python, C++
Tools: Git, SolidWorks
Math processing : Mathematica, Matlab

Intermediate level:  I am competent enough to accomplish important tasks, but have not used these extensively.
OS: MacOS, Windows, Linux/Unix
Markup: LaTeX, HTML/CSS
Statistical: R, Excel
Graphic Design: Adobe Creative Suite
Computer Vision: openCV

Beginner level - I have been exposed to this, and while I have not used in any major projects, I have learnt the syntax and used it for small projects.
Javascript, Ruby, Scala, Verilog, Raspberry Pi


Descriptions of projects 
Please see code samples in GitHub

Java - USA Computing Olympiad (USACO), AP Computer Science, Misc projects
Python - scripting, Intermediate Python class at Art of Problem Solving
C++ - USACO, Misc.
Android - Robotics, Development
Mathematica - Modeling math problems
Matlab - Research
Miscellaneous - see GitHub.

Java: I have taken AP Computer Science in 9th grade and received a 5. I have also participated in USACO, using Java as well as C++. I have written in Java for the majority of my programming career, focusing on algorithmically hard questions. I have studied a variety of algorithms, including stable matching, depth first search, breadth first search, topological sort, dynamic programming, shortest paths, greedy algorithms, network flow, and spanning trees, to name a few at the Program in Algorithmic and Combinatorial Thinking (PACT) camp at Princeton University. The PACT year-long program involved studying the book Algorithm Design by Jon Kleinberg and Ã‰va Tardos at a senior undergraduate level.

Python: I have used python in my earlier computer science activities. I built a simultaneous equation solver using Cramer's rule in 8th grade, as well as various games  like minesweeper, sudoku, and solitaire using event-based programing. I continued to use it for writing scripts to perform menial tasks, like organizing music and converting files.

Android - I have used Android in robotics (FTC, FRC) to develop a computer vision library for identifying various objects on a playing field using openCV. I also have helped develop several apps as part of the computer science club at my school.

Mathematica - I have used Mathematica to tutor students in math, and I developed notebooks that demonstrate mathematical concepts from simple one variable equations to vector fields and gradients.

Matlab - I have used Matlab in my research project to calculate the laplacian matrix and eigenvalues of a dataset containing 3D Models. I have also used it to simulate relevant theorems and plot models of variables of interest.

R - I have used R in my AP Statistics class, to simulate the concepts I learned theoretically, as well as to conduct various small experiments.

Adobe Creative Suite - I have used Adobe software in a magazine design class in 9th grade: https://issuu.com/lasaezine/docs/gigahertz_magazine 

I have used SPICE and Arduino in Digital Electronics (an elective high school class) in 10th grade. We used SPICE to simulate various circuits and modules, like capacitors, flip-flops, transistors, and adders. We used LOGISIM to build a Arithmetic Logic Unit capable of executing machine code.

Solidworks: I used Solidworks in an engineering design course in 9th grade to design and create a device capable of executing a simple task. I used this software to model my design of an extending scissor arm powered by mousetraps and rubber bands.

HTML/CSS - I have used HTML and CSS to help peers create functioning websites.

LaTex - I have used LaTex to write math assignments throughout high school, as well as to write my research paper, which is in progress.

OS: I have worked on all 3 major operating systems, and I have experience using and programming on Mac, Windows, and Linux.

I have written miscellaneous programs throughout my career, several of which can be found on GitHub.
